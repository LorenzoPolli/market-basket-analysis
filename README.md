This project aims at investigating techniques generally used to conduct market-basket analysis
over huge datasets in order to find frequent itemsets.
In this specific case, the dataset is taken from the public repository [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alvations/old-newspapers) and contains more than 16 million of paragraphs about old newspapers. Although the newspapers were written in 67
different languages, for the scope of the research, the analysis is conducted over English newspapers
only. In total, a subset of more than 1 million articles published between the years 2005 and 2012
were analyzed, using algorithms for massive datasets.
